    "However, in the case of our problem, $\\partial_n u =0$ on $\\Gamma_N$ and $v=0$ on $\\Gamma_D$ so that the last term is null as $\\partial\\Omega = \\Gamma_D \\cup \\Gamma_N$.\n",

    "## Boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We distinguish two types of boundardy conditions: ones which are applied directly to the definition space of the function (Dirichlet boudnary conditions, also called essential boundary conditions), and conditions enforced in the weak formulation which appear when using Green's theorem (called Neumann or natural boundary conditions). The latter is enforced through the weak form."
